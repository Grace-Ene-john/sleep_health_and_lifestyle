## Insights

### Sleep Duration & Quality
- Average sleep duration is **~7.1 hours**, which aligns with recommended guidelines.  
- However, many individuals still report **sleep disorders**, indicating **quality matters more than quantity**.  

### Stress & Sleep
- Average stress level: **~5.4 (out of 10)**.  
- Higher stress levels are commonly linked with lower sleep quality and presence of disorders like **insomnia**.  

### Sleep Disorders
- **~40%** of participants have a sleep disorder.  
- **Insomnia and Sleep Apnea** are almost equally prevalent.  
- Participants without disorders generally report **better sleep quality and more consistent sleep duration**.  

### Occupation Influence
- **Healthcare professionals (Nurses & Doctors)** form the largest group.  
- These roles are often associated with **shift work, long hours, and high stress**, which may contribute to **sleep problems**.  

### Gender Balance
- Dataset is nearly balanced: **189 Males vs. 185 Females**

## SQL
The following SQL queries were used to extract key insights from the dataset
   
```sql
---Average Sleep Duration by Occupation---
SELECT 
    Occupation,
    ROUND(AVG([Sleep Duration]), 2) AS Avg_Sleep_Hours
FROM SleepData
GROUP BY Occupation
ORDER BY Avg_Sleep_Hours DESC;
```

```sql
---Sleep Disorder Distribution by Gender---
SELECT 
    Gender,
    [Sleep Disorder],
    COUNT(*) AS Num_People
FROM SleepData
GROUP BY Gender, [Sleep Disorder]
ORDER BY Gender, Num_People DESC;
```
